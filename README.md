Go Utilities
==

A collection of shared Go utilities for my projects.  

Comprising of mostly interfaces and wrappers for concrete/hard-to-test packages 
of other packages, these allow the user to unit test their code locally.

I try to document as I write 'em; but, feel free to create an issue requesting
more documentation (or if you have general questions).
